# Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for a Complex Backend System

## Level 0 (Context Diagram)

At the highest level, the system interacts with external entities such as Users, Admins, Payment Gateway, and AI Recommendation Engine. The data flow between these entities and the system is as follows:

### External Entities & Interactions:

- **Users** → Authenticate, browse content, subscribe, stream, interact, and provide ratings.
- **Admin** → Manages content, subscriptions, user access, and analytics.
- **Payment Gateway** → Handles subscription payments and transactions.
- **AI Recommendation Engine** → Processes user data to provide personalized content recommendations.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN) & DRM System** → Ensures secure content delivery and protection against unauthorized use.
- **AWS Services** → Includes **S3 (Storage)**, **Lambda (Compute)**, **DynamoDB (Cache)**, **CloudFront (Streaming)**, **Cognito (Authentication)**, and more.

### High-Level Data Flow:

- Users authenticate using JWT tokens.
- Admins manage content and user roles.
- Payment system validates and processes subscriptions.
- Content is streamed securely with DRM controls.
- AI recommendations are served based on user watch history.
- Content metadata is fetched dynamically.

## Level 1 (Detailed Subsystems Breakdown)

### 1. Authentication & Authorization (JWT, Multi-Device Login, AWS Cognito)

- Users login using email/password or OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- JWT tokens are issued and validated for each request.
- Multi-device session management is handled using AWS Cognito.

### 2. Content Management (MongoDB, ExpressJS, S3, CloudFront)

- Admins upload and manage content metadata (titles, descriptions, ratings, cast, release date).
- Videos are stored in **AWS S3** and streamed using **CloudFront**.
- Access to content is restricted based on subscription plans.

### 3. Subscription & Payment System (Stripe, Razorpay, AWS Lambda)

- Users subscribe via Stripe/Razorpay.
- Payment gateway processes transactions and updates subscription details.
- AWS Lambda triggers updates for user subscriptions.

### 4. Secure Streaming & DRM (AWS CloudFront, DRM Integration)

- DRM prevents unauthorized downloads.
- If downloaded, content is encrypted and can only be played in authenticated runtime.
- Quality adapts dynamically based on subscription and network speed.

### 5. Live Streaming (AWS Media Services, WebSockets, Auto-scaling)

- WebSockets manage real-time interactions.
- AWS Media Services handles live stream encoding.
- Auto-scaling ensures high availability during peak loads.

### 6. AI-Based Recommendations (Machine Learning, MongoDB Aggregation)

- AI engine analyzes user watch history and engagement.
- MongoDB aggregation is used for filtering and sorting content.
- Recommendations are dynamically updated.

### 7. User Engagement & Interaction (Likes, Comments, Resume Watching, Watchlist)

- Users can like, comment, and save content to their watchlist.
- Resume watching enables playback from where the user left off.

### 8. Security & Access Control (JWT, API Gateway, IAM Roles)

- Role-based access control ensures security.
- API Gateway manages request authentication.
- AWS IAM roles control backend service access.

### 9. Monetization (Advertisements, Premium Plans, Offers)

- Ads are displayed for free-tier users.
- Subscription plans control content quality and access.
- Special offers are managed dynamically.
