### **ðŸ”¥ 50 Advanced MongoDB Sharding Questions for Your OTT Platform**

Since your OTT platform handles **users, content, watch history, ratings, and subscriptions**, sharding is crucial for scalability and performance. These **50 questions** cover **shard keys selection, performance optimization, query distribution, balancing, chunk migration, and best practices**.

---

## **ðŸ”¥ Sharding Strategy & Basics**
1. What is the best shard key for the `Users` collection? (`Email`, `Username`, or `Region`?)
2. Should `Users` be sharded based on `Email` (hashed) or `Region` (ranged)? Why?
3. What is the best shard key for the `Content` collection? (`contentType`, `genre`, or `IMDbRating`?)
4. How would you shard the `WatchList` collection for efficient retrieval of user-specific data?
5. Should `Ratings` be sharded based on `ContentId` or `UserId`? Why?
6. How do you determine if a collection should be **sharded or remain unsharded**?
7. What are the **pros and cons** of choosing a **hashed shard key vs. ranged shard key** for `Users`?
8. How would you shard the `Subscriptions` collection for fast **renewal tracking**?
9. What are **zones in sharding**, and how can you use them to optimize **regional content availability**?
10. How can **pre-splitting chunks** improve the initial performance of sharded collections?

## **ðŸ”¥ Performance & Query Optimization**
11. How would you distribute shards across **multiple regions** to optimize latency?
12. What is the best way to **balance read-heavy and write-heavy** workloads using sharding?
13. How does **write concern** impact the performance of a sharded cluster?
14. How can you optimize queries to avoid **scatter-gather operations** in a sharded cluster?
15. What strategies can you use to ensure that **sharded queries** target a **single shard** instead of all shards?
16. How do **compound shard keys** help optimize query performance?
17. What MongoDB commands can you use to analyze the **distribution of chunks** in a sharded collection?
18. What is **jumbo chunk** in MongoDB sharding, and how do you fix it?
19. How does **sharding affect indexing**, and what are best practices for indexing a sharded collection?
20. How do you ensure that **user authentication queries (login requests)** are optimized in a sharded database?

## **ðŸ”¥ Content-Based Sharding**
21. Should content be sharded by `genres` or `contentType`? Why?
22. How would you **shard content based on subscription plans** to optimize access control?
23. How would you implement **regional sharding** so that users in different countries get content specific to them?
24. What impact does sharding by `IMDbRating` have on **query performance**?
25. What happens if the `Content` collection is **sharded incorrectly**, and how do you fix it?
26. How do you distribute **trending content** across shards to prevent hotspots?
27. How can **aggregation queries on content performance** be optimized in a sharded cluster?
28. Should `Likes` and `Views` fields be **stored separately and referenced**, or kept within the `Content` collection? Why?
29. How would you optimize the retrieval of **most-watched content per region** in a sharded cluster?
30. How do you handle **content expiration** (i.e., removing expired content) efficiently in a sharded database?

---

## **ðŸ”¥ User-Based Sharding**
31. Should user accounts be **sharded by region, subscription plan, or account creation date**?
32. How do you handle **user migrations between shards** when they change their subscription or region?
33. How can you optimize queries that fetch **user watch history** in a sharded environment?
34. How do you ensure that **password reset and authentication queries** remain fast in a sharded environment?
35. How do you shard `User Ratings` so that retrieving the **most-rated content** is fast?
36. How do you handle **inactive users** in a sharded cluster?
37. Should **user-generated reviews** be sharded along with the user or the content? Why?
38. How do you efficiently shard and retrieve **binge-watching patterns** for analytics?
39. How do you distribute **frequent vs. infrequent users** across shards for better load balancing?
40. Should `WatchList` be embedded inside `Users` or exist as a **separate sharded collection**?

## **ðŸ”¥ Scaling & Administration**
41. What MongoDB command is used to **enable sharding on a collection**?
42. How do you **split a shard** that is becoming overloaded?
43. What command is used to **force a chunk migration** in MongoDB?
44. What are **balancing policies**, and how do you customize them for different workloads?
45. How do you **move a collection from one shard to another**?
46. How do you monitor the **current chunk distribution** across shards?
47. How do you detect **hot shards** and rebalance them dynamically?
48. How do you ensure **shard key selection** does not cause **uneven chunk distribution**?
49. What is the impact of **sharding on backups** and how do you ensure data consistency?
50. How do you test the **query performance of a sharded vs. unsharded collection**?

## **ðŸš€ API Use Cases for Sharding**
Each of these **sharding strategies** can be applied to real-world API use cases such as:

- **User Authentication Optimization**
  - `/api/login` â†’ Use **hashed shard key on Email**
- **Content Availability**
  - `/api/trending-content/:region` â†’ Use **sharding by region**
- **Subscription Management**
  - `/api/expiring-subscriptions` â†’ Use **sharding by subscriptionExpiry**
- **Personalized Watchlist**
  - `/api/user-watchlist/:userId` â†’ Use **sharding by userId**
- **Top Content Analytics**
  - `/api/top-content/:genre` â†’ Use **sharding by genre**
- **Content Discovery**
  - `/api/content-by-subscription/:planType` â†’ Use **sharding by subscription plan**
